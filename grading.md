# Grading

The bootcamp makes up 10% of your final grade. It’s calculated based on whether students engage in assignments. Each assignment is graded **ok** or **not ok**.

## Effort

The below table breaks down the general time needed to complete activities.

| Activity                |     Effort |
| ----------------------- | ---------: |
| Lab (6 × 1:40h)         |     10:00h |
| Lab (6 × 3h)            |     18h    |
